# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this project does not publish any library, there is no versioning
scheme applied and no releases are made. However, the main branch gets
renovated once a week fixing potential security issues of the project's
dependencies.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case you find a vulnerability in the project itself, please let me know
by sending me an email to the address provided in my profile. I will take
care of it as soon as possible.
